# Windsurf Installer üöÄ

A simple Bash script to **install**, **update**, and **uninstall** the **Windsurf IDE** on Linux.

**Before you begin, you must download the script or clone the repository to your local machine.**

## Features üéâ

- Minimal and clear logs for success, errors, and warnings.

## Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

Before running the script, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- `curl`, `tar`, `grep`, `sed`, `mktemp`, `basename`, `dirname`, `cut`
- Optional: `sha256sum` (for checksum verification)
- Root privileges are required to install/uninstall.

## Installation Flow üîÑ

1. The script fetches the latest version of Windsurf IDE from the official API.
2. It checks if any updates are needed for your existing installation.
3. The script downloads the `.tar.gz` archive and verifies the checksum.
4. It extracts the files and installs them to `/opt/windsurf`.
5. The script creates a symbolic link and desktop entry for easy access.

## Uninstallation üßπ

To remove the IDE completely, run:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --uninstall
```

This will remove:

- The installation directory (`/opt/windsurf`).
- The symlink (`/usr/local/bin/windsurf`).
- The desktop entry (`/usr/share/applications/windsurf.desktop`).

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

- **Missing dependencies**: If the script can't find required tools, it will notify you. Install them using your package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`).
- **Checksum verification failure**: If the downloaded file doesn't match the expected checksum, the installation will fail to protect against corrupted files. Ensure a stable internet connection and retry.

- **Desktop entry not created**: If the script fails to create a desktop entry, it will fall back to a generic icon. Make sure you have `update-desktop-database` installed, or manually check the installation directory for the desktop entry.

- **Permissions issues**: The script needs root privileges for installation and uninstallation. If you encounter permission errors, ensure you're running the script with `sudo`.
